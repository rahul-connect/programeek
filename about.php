	  HTML ,CSS, Bootstrap, Materilizecss, Javascript, PHP, MYSQL, CodeIgniter, Angularjs, NodeJs, MongoDb, ExpressJs etc etc. 
	  Presently only the LAMP Stack is available but within few Months the complete MEAN Stack will be available too.</p>
	
	  <p style="font-size:20px;text-indent:50px;text-align: justify;padding:0px 6px;">
	  We provide our users two options - Either they learn the language through Tutorials and then go for Code Snippets OR If they know the basic of the language,they can directly jump into snippets.Some of u might think what are Code Snippets? 
	  </p>
	  <p style="font-size:20px;text-indent: 50px;text-align: justify;padding:0px 6px;">
	  Code Snippets are small pieces of codes which perform some functionality. For Example You want the code for uploading image to the server then you can see that Code Snippet and then understand the concept behind the functionality and then use the code in your website.
	  </p><br>
	  <p style="font-size:20px;text-indent: 50px;text-align: justify;padding:0px 6px;">
	  If you encounter any doubt while learning or stuck anywhere in the code then feel free to ask your doubt in the 'ASK ANY DOUBT' section of each post. Moreover If u want any tutorial or CodeSnippet related to languages which are present in the category, then u can tell us via 'Request a Tutorial'.
